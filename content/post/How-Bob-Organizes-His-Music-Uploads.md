Bob's blues band, the Biloxy Barn Burners has put out many albums over the years.

He wants to upload them into the v4v Decentralized Music (DeMu) ecosystem but he's not really sure how to organize the music.

They've put out 10 albums so far. Each album has 2 to 4 really great songs that are fan favorites (singles)

Bob want's to make sure that his fans can get easy access to these songs as singles.

So he starts creating the RSS feeds needed to accomplish this and soon realizes that in order to accomplish this task he would have to create at least 30 RSS feeds (10 for each album and a minimum of 2 singles per album)

Bob thought to himself that this was a bit too much to manage and there had to be a better way.

Being a child of the 70's Bob remembered how record companies would release music. 

Back in the olden days of vinyl records when a band released albums the record company would also release singles (45's). This was primarily because it was cheaper for a person to buy a single than the whole album and it also served as a way to market the album. Kind of like a try before you buy system.

Then as the band released many albums those singles would often get released into an album of their own called "Greatest Hits" or something similar.

If the band was really prolific they may have "Greatest Hits Vol 1", "Greatest Hits Vol 2", "Greatest Hits Vol 3", etc.

Bob wondered if he could recreate such a system using the new v4v music system.

If he thought of each feed as being it's own album then would need to create 10 feeds, one for each album. This makes sense but how should he handle singles?

Then it dawned on him. The reason singles existed in the past was to allow someone to "try before you buy". That no longer applies in this modern system. Then he remembered that singles were also a way to market the album. This is still very much in need.

Since the modern v4v DeMu system is based on podcasts it occurred to him that he could just release his singles as an episodic podcast.

He decided that he would create a feed called "The Biloxi Barn Burners Singles" Any new songs that his band released that were single worthy would get added to that feed.

Then since he already had a ton of older hit songs recorded he decided to put them inside a feed called "The Biloxi Barn Burners Greatest Hits"

So now Bob only has to create 12 feeds instead of 30+. Not only does this make life easier for him but his fans can now find their music more easily because it's nicely organized.

Bob creates:
- 10 feeds, one for each album
- 1 feed for their Greatest Hits
- 1 feed for newly released singles


Jane is a huge fan of The Biloxi Barn Burners and she subscribes to their singles feed in her favorite [modern podcast app](https://podcastindex.org/apps?appTypes=app&elements=Value%2CBoostagrams)

This morning on her way to work she got a new notification on her phone that a new single from The Biloxi Barn Burners just was released. Excited she listens to the new song on her commute to work. She loved the song so much that she sent them a boostagram of 20,000 satoshis saying "I was having a bad day until you new song dropped into my phone, now everything is great. I really love you guys keep putting out great tunes üòç"
