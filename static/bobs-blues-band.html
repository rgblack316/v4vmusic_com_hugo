                <p><strong>(close up of Bob)</strong>
                    This is Bob, Bob is in a band, <strong>(zoom out to reveal band members on stage, text of their name
                        next to each one appears when their name is said)</strong> with Alice, Charlie, David and Erin.
                    Bob&rsquo;s band is the The Biloxi Barn Burners <strong>(zoom in or cut to bass drum revealing The
                        BBB&rsquo;s

                </p>
                <p>They work very hard and make great music which they publish to many Internet platforms.
                    <strong>(screenshot of music submission pages, fake logos of spotify, youtube, bandcamp,
                        etc)</strong> They have quite a few listeners and fans, but because of the way the system is set
                    up, they receive very little money for their efforts. <strong>(screenshot of earnings showing $25
                        earnings for the year)</strong>
                </p>
                <p><strong>(cut to bob at a btc conference talking with a young blonde girl wearing a pink feather
                        coat)</strong>
                    One day Bob was at a Bitcoin conference and learned about a new way for bands to earn money using
                    Bitcoin and something called value for value. <strong>(graphic showing wallet, RSS, web host, and
                        mp3 file)</strong>
                    He learns that all he needs is a bitcoin lightning wallet, an RSS feed, a web host and an mp3 file.
                </p>
                <p><strong>(Screenshot of value4value.info)</strong> He even does some research about the value for
                    value model at value4value.info</p>
                <p><strong>(Bob talking with the gang Alby logo and ⚡️ in speaking balloon)</strong> Eager to try this
                    new system out he gets a Bitcoin lightning wallet and encourages Alice, Charlie, David, and Erin to
                    do the same.
                </p>
                <p><strong>(screenshot of music side project splits)</strong> Then he creates an RSS feed for their
                    first album using a free online tool at musicsideproject.com
                    and sets up a split on each song to give 20% to each of the 5 band members.
                </p>
                <p><strong>(screenshot of filezilla uploading files)</strong> He publishes his RSS feed as well as the
                    mp3 files and artwork for their album on their website TheBiloxiBarnBurners.com
                </p>
                <p><strong>(screenshot of podcast index submission)</strong> Then he submitted his RSS feed to
                    podcastindex.org
                </p>
                <p><strong>(some sort of animation depicting moving of the rss file to various podcast apps)</strong>
                    Through the magic of podping and RSS other music sites such as lnbeats.com automatically sees that a
                    new music album has been published and makes it available for anyone to listen.
                </p>
                <p><strong>(screenshot of fountain search)</strong> His album even shows up when searching in his
                    favorite modern podcast app.
                </p>
                <p><strong>(graphic of The BBB&rsquo;s logo traveling around the globe)</strong> The Biloxi Barn
                    Burner&rsquo;s music is now published to the whole world.
                </p>
                <p>Now all Bob needs to do is educate his fans to use a modern podcast app to listen to The Biloxi Barn
                    Burner&rsquo;s music. <strong>(Screenshots of social Media)</strong> He does this by advertising it
                    on the band&rsquo;s social media, doing interviews, talking with his friends and generally spreading
                    the word however he can.
                </p>
                <p><strong>(Close up of Jane wearing earbuds and holding a phone)</strong> Jane is a lover of music. She
                    discovers The Biloxi Barn Burners while listening to random songs on lnbeats.com. She really is
                    digging their song &ldquo;I got The Not Your Keys, Not Your Bitcoin, Rug Pull Blues&rdquo; and
                    decides to send them some support.
                </p>
                <p><strong>(screen shot of boost screen)</strong> She taps on the boost button and boosts 10,000 in
                    satoshis towards the song.
                </p>
                <p>Now something almost magical happens. <strong>(Animation of satoshis flowing from Jane&rsquo;s phone
                        through the lightning network across the globe and landing in each band members lightning
                        wallet)</strong> Jane&rsquo;s podcast app, Lnbeats reads the Biloxi Barn Burners RSS feed and
                    notices that when someone boosts this song the amount is to be divided up. 20% to Alice, 20% to Bob,
                    20% to Charlie, 20% to David, and 20% to Erin. Lnbeats then instructs Jane&rsquo;s bitcoin wallet to
                    send 5 separate payments of 2,000 satoshis to each of the band members.
                </p>
                <p>Jane has just paid from her own bitcoin wallet to each member of the band directly. No middlemen
                    involved, no royalty companies, no record contracts. Just direct value for value transfer from
                    listener to musician.

                </p>
                <p>At this point the future is uncertain as to how much the The Biloxi Barn Burners will earn but one
                    thing for certain is that they are getting a much larger percentage of their earnings than they
                    could get anywhere else in the industry.</p>
